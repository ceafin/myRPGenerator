INSTALLATION
----------------------------------------------------
Note: You need the following installed on your computer to run RPGGen:
- Python 2.7
  - Available here: http://www.python.org/download/
  - OSX and Linux should already have this, though it may not be the latest version of 2.7 (shouldn't be a problem though)
  - On Windows you'll want your PATH environment variable to include the path to the Python executable
- wxPython 2.8
  - Available here: http://www.wxpython.org/download.php
  - Download the version for Python 2.7
  
  
RUNNING THE PROGRAM
----------------------------------------------------
Mac OSX: Run "mac_runme.command"

Windows: Run "windows_runme.cmd"

Linux: Not sure, though the Mac file may work. Linux users can probably figure it out without my help.
